My favorite album currently is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm0ru2iBuB0" target="_blank"> 
<em> Between Days</em></a> by Far Caspian.
Ever since YouTube introduced me to this album last year I've had it on repeat.
It's got very high replay value, and I can listen to it when I'm driving, working out, or just chillin in my room.
<br> <br> I think my favorite thing about about this music is the instrumentals. They have a lot of acoustics that are very pleasing.
It gives me a sense of nostalgia when I listen to this album. The album is filled with straight bangers but my favorite song has to be <em> Let's go outside </em>.
